# Lune

This is a stereoscopic viewer for the Moon in Google Cardboard, built with WebGL and THREE.js.

The boilerplate code is from a [VR Chrome Experiment](https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/).

I used a 3D model of the Moon uploaded by [nicola3dmodels at free3d.com](https://free3d.com/3d-model/moon-17150.html).

*Term project for ECSE-4750 Computer Graphics, and creative project for ASTR-2020 Earth & Sky.*

## Instructions

Clone this repo and open index.html. Eventually I'll have this up and running on [dawneraq.github.io](https://dawneraq.github.io).
