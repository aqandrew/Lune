# Lune

This is a stereoscopic viewer for the Moon in Google Cardboard, built with WebGL and THREE.js. So far only tested on an iPhone 6.

The boilerplate code is from a [VR Chrome Experiment](https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/).

I used a 3D model of the Moon uploaded by [nicola3dmodels at free3d.com](https://free3d.com/3d-model/moon-17150.html).

*Term project for ECSE-4750 Computer Graphics, and creative project for ASTR-2020 Earth & Sky.*

## About the Moon

Why visualize the Moon? Earth's moon is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to its host planet. It's a space object of profound significance because it's the most luminous body in the night sky, it acts as the source of tidal forces, and it stabilizes Earth's oblique spin axis in order for us to have seasons. Not only is the Moon important to life on Earth, but it's beautiful as well.

As you can see, the lunar surface is covered with impact craters. These craters were formed by collisions with interplanetary debris traveling at about 20 km/s (44,739 mph) on average. The darker regions (_mare_), seen mostly on the near side, are rich in iron and are thought to have been formed by cooled magma.

The presence of magma suggests volcanism, but its volcanoes don't resemble Earth's. Instead of volcanic mountains, lunar magma tends to form smooth planes like Mare Imbrium in the Moon's northwest.
